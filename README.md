HoloLabs is a mobile application that allows students to test, experiment, and create holographic laboratories or artworks.

Kids have always been intrinsically creative but there are factors that limit creativity:
- Some experiments can be hazardous
- Logistically difficult
- Expensive materials and equipment

HoloLabs overcome these limitations to allow students to learn and explore
